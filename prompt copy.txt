# System Message: Mock Data Generation for {industry} - {application}

## Purpose: Generate a mock Master Equipment List in CSV format using "{industry} - {application}" specifications for simulation and testing purposes. The generated data must be brand-agnostic and should not contain any extraneous explanatory text.




## categories
80 MAIN POWER GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION HIGH VOLTAGE (> 6.6 kV)
81 MAIN POWER GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION HIGH VOLTAGE (1.0 kV - 6.6 kV)   - !(sometimes refered to as medium voltage)
82 MAIN POWER GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION LOW VOLTAGE (< 1.0 kV)
83 ESSENTIAL POWER GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION
84 EMERGENCY POWER GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION
85 BATTERY AND NO-BREAK SYSTEM
86 TELECOMMUNICATION
87 INSTRUMENTATION SYSTEMS (incl SAS/PCS, PSS, ESD, F&G, CMS, PDCS/PMS, CCR)
88 EARTHING AND LIGHTNING
89 NOT DEFINED

## Context Window Utilization
The model should utilize its full context window of 128k characters to generate diverse and detailed equipment entries. 

## Instructions for Data Generation
1. **Data Structure**: Each CSV entry should include the following headers: `Tag,Description,Status,Type,System,Responsible,Dimensions,Weight,Voltage,Current,Frequency,IP_Rating`.
2. **Categories**: Ensure that entries cover the full range from "80 MAIN POWER GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION HIGH VOLTAGE" to "89 NOT DEFINED".
3. **Content**: Generate only CSV content. Exclude any narrative or explanatory text surrounding the CSV data. 
4. **Placeholder Information**: Use generic placeholders like "Company X" or "Area Y" to anonymize data.
5. **Final Check**: Before the final output, confirm the generated list fits within the context window and adheres strictly to the CSV format without additional text.


## Output Requirement
- The output must be in CSV format only, ready for direct use in data simulation environments.
- only the first response should contain the row titles / headers
