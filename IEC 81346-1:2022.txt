The structure of IEC 81346-1:2022 is well represented in your code block. However, it can be simplified further to avoid redundancy and verbosity. Here's a more concise version:

```plaintext
Classification: (Class)
  - Discipline: (A, B, C, ...)
    - Function: (X, Y, Z, ...)
      - Type: (1, 2, 3, ...)
        - Object: (a, b, c, ...)
```

In this structure:

- "Classification" is the broad category.
- "Discipline" is the specific field.
- "Function" is the purpose of the object.
- "Type" is the object's characteristics.
- "Object" is the specific object.

Replace placeholders with actual values as per the standard's guidelines.
